# python-cat-gallery
A pet project that displays a gallery of cat pictures and cat info.

Will be able to add a new picture with the cat's info, update the info, delete a picture, and such and so for a regular CRUD app.

Extensibility will come for various authors, and such, but first version should be incredibly simple, otherwise I'll just shelve it again :)

TODO: Add Dog capabilities.
